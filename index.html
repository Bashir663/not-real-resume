    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a college student nearing the graduation phase of his bachelor's
      degree. I do be looking forward to start a job afterwards in your fine
      establishment and taking care of all web developer related tasks. Still
      inexperienced but I'm very much willing to learn and adapt as well as
      solidify my placement in the company as a go-to guy for related
      questions/concerns. I'd love to help out and make a difference in people's
      lives when possible.
