    <h1>my main hobby wobby</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>VIDJA GAMES</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the time I play an offline game to help relax and get immersed
      into another world for a few hours. Usually it's an offline game. <br />
      Sometimes I play with friends and I love knowing everything about a game
      and then helping out some buds after I've gained experience in it
    </p>
    <h3>Some games I currently play:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stardew Valley <br />
        It's extremely relaxing but I love going tryhard and getting money as
        soon as possible and marrying by the start of the second year
      </li>
      <li>
        Genshin Impact <br />
        It started off strong, with an immersively large terrain to explore and
        dungeons to conquer, but after you've completed everything (Which, trust
        me, takes a LONG time to reach that point which is a nice plus), the
        only thing that becomes exciting are the new characters and perhaps the
        main story they add to once a year
      </li>
      <li>
        Minecraft <br />
        It's a classic, usually though I'm playing it in a modpack or with
        friends on vanilla (both if god is good)
      </li>
      <li>
        Terraria <br />
        Honestly, I've done so many playthroughs of this game i lost count. Must
        be above 40 worlds i've played through, and each one takes around 40
        hours for completion. Better game than minecraft IMO but not as popular,
        still, it's my top games out there.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>ANIMES</h2>
    <p>
      I do consume quite a bit of anime while playing a game that doesn't really
      rely on sounds or when im doing something monotonous such as washing
      dishes. The hidden gems of film are worth digging through the rubble you
      find most of the time. One of my favorite parts of animes have to be the
      intros and outros, they slap so hard, these people need a raise.
    </p>
    <h2>Top few best animes imo!</h2>

          This anime hit me hard, so many times i lost count. The first season
          is a masterpiece, ESPECIALLY its ending HOLY JESUS I almost cried. I
          was close to tearing up a couple times as well throughout it. Love
          Rem. She deserves everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second season was amazing as well. I really felt the mans' struggle
          and almost ending himself was way too close. But the way he changes
          after all that nonsese, just makes me wanna do some shit. Sad that
          there is nothing about Rem though.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Attack on Titan</h4>
        <p>
          This shit ain't even done sending banger after banger. Got me fucked
          up with the season 3 end. Entire world as we know it crumbling apart
          and reforming.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h4>Danganronpa</h4>
        <p>
          The animes, and the games especially. Bangers all around except the
          2.5 special episode or whatever. Absolutely loved seeing the detective
          shit go wild and crazy ass plans and figuring them out in the games.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>The Promised Neverland (First season only)</h4>
        <p>
          fuckass second season was just a whole load of baloney. First episode
          of first season gets you hella hooked and the characters become
          lovable. I wouldn't watch it again tho lul.
